   .. note::

      -  You can remove a policy from a vault when the vault resources are being backed up. In this case, backup tasks will continue, and backups will be generated.
      -  After a policy is removed, backups retained by **Time period** will expire based on the retention rule, but backups retained by **Backup quantity** will not. You need manually delete unwanted backups.

#. Click **Yes**.

   Tasks will no longer be executed based on this policy for the vault.

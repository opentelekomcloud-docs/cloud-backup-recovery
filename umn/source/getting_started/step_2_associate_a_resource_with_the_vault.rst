Step 2: Associate a Resource with the Vault
===========================================

If you have already associated servers, file systems, or disks when creating a vault, skip this step.

After a server backup vault or disk backup vault is created, you can associate servers, file systems, or disks with the vault to back up these resources.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  A vault can be associated with a maximum of 256 resources.
-  The servers you plan to associate with a vault must have at least one disk attached.
-  The vault and the resources you plan to associate with it must be in the same region.
-  The total size of the resources to be associated cannot be greater than the vault capacity.
-  Resources can be associated only when they are in the statuses in the table below.

   .. table:: **Table 1** Statuses of the resources available for association

      ===================== ===================
      Resource Type         Status
      ===================== ===================
      Cloud server          Running or Stopped
      Cloud disk            Available or In-use
      SFS Turbo file system Available
      ===================== ===================

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the CBR console.

   a. In the upper left corner, click |image1| and select a region.
   b. Click |image2| and choose **Storage** > **Cloud Backup and Recovery**.

#. Locate the target vault and click **Associate Server**, **Associate File System**, or **Associate Disk**.

#. In the resource list, select the resources you want to associate with the vault. After resources are selected, they are added to the list of selected resources.

#. Click **OK**. You can view the number of associated resources in the **Associated Servers**, **Associated Disks**, or **Associated File Systems** column.

   .. note::

      After a new disk is added to the associated server, the system automatically identifies the new disk and backs up the new disk.

Automatic Association
---------------------

If you enable automatic association for a backup vault, the vault will automatically associate the unprotected resources and back them up according to the backup policy applied to the vault.

-  The vault's remaining capacity should be greater than both 40 GB and the capacity of the associated resources (Remaining capacity of a vault = Total capacity of the vault - Capacity of resources associated with the vault). The vault will automatically scan and associate unprotected servers in the next backup cycle and perform backup. You can obtain the vault's total capacity and the capacity of associated resources in the **Basic Information** area on the details page of the vault. For example, if you have an 800-GB server backup vault and it has been associated with two 100-GB servers, its remaining capacity is 600 GB (800 GB - 200 GB). In this case, the vault will automatically associate unprotected servers in the next backup cycle and perform backup.
-  If multiple vaults are enabled with automatic association, CBR scans their backup policies and associates resources with the vault whose next scheduled backup time is the earliest.
-  If the capacity of the first selected vault is used up, resources will be associated with the vault whose next scheduled backup time is the second earliest.
-  If a backup policy with the earliest scheduled backup time is applied to more than one vault, CBR randomly selects one of these vaults to associate the resources with.
-  If a vault has automatic association enabled but has no backup policy applied, no resources will be automatically associated with this vault. You can manually associate unprotected resources.
-  After automatic association is disabled for a vault, the vault stops automatic scanning for unprotected resources, but associated resources remain associated.

#. Log in to the CBR console.

   a. Log in to the management console.
   b. In the upper left corner, click |image4| and select a region.
   c. Choose **Storage** > **Cloud Backup and Recovery**.

#. Locate the target vault.

#. Choose **More** > **Enable Automatic Association** in the **Operation** column of the vault.

   You can filter unprotected resources by tag. If a tag is selected, only unprotected resources with the specified tag will be associated with the vault. Or, all unprotected resources will be associated.

   If no tag is available, you can create tags on the corresponding resource page. You can search for vaults by specifying a maximum of 5 tags at a time. If you select more than one tag, the vaults with any of the specified tags will be returned.

#. Check that **Automatic association** is displayed in the **Associated Servers** column of the vault list.

#. (Optional) If automatic association is not required, choose **More** > **Disable Automatic Association** in the **Operation** column of the vault.

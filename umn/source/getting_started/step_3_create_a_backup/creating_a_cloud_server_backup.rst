Creating a Cloud Server Backup
==============================

This section describes how to quickly create a cloud server backup.

If you do not need an ECS for the moment, you can back up the ECS and then delete it. When you want an ECS later, you can create an image from the ECS backup and use the image to create ECSs.

Backing up a server does not impact the server performance.

Peak hours of the backup service are from 00:00 to 06:00, during which backup schedules may be delayed. So you are advised to evaluate your service types and schedule backups outside of the backup peak hours.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Only servers in the **Running** or **Stopped** state can be backed up.
-  At least one server backup vault is available.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to CBR Console.

   a. Log in to the management console.
   b. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select a region.
   c. Click |image2| and choose **Storage** > **Cloud Backup and Recovery**. Select a backup type from the left navigation pane.

#. On the **Cloud Server Backups** page, click the **Vaults** tab and find the vault to which the server is associated.

#. Perform backup in either of the following ways:

   -  Choose **More** > **Perform Backup** in the **Operation** column. In the server list, select the server you want to back up. After a server is selected, it is added to the list of selected servers. See :ref:`Figure 1 <cbr_02_0006__fig2557455115213>`.

   -  Click the vault name to go to the vault details page. On the **Associated Servers** tab page, locate the target server and click **Perform Backup** in the **Operation** column. See :ref:`Figure 2 <cbr_02_0006__fig12341420103610>`.

#. Choose whether to enable full backup. If full backup is enabled, CBR performs a full backup on every associated server, which requires a larger capacity compared to an incremental backup. See :ref:`Figure 3 <cbr_02_0006__fig789511544815>`.

   **Figure 3** Full Backup

   |image5|

#. Click **OK**. CBR automatically creates a backup for the server.

   On the **Backups** tab page, if the status of the backup is **Available**, the backup task is successful.

   .. note::

      A server can be restarted if the backup progress exceeds 10%. However, to ensure data integrity, restart it after the backup is complete.

   After the backup is complete, you can use the backup to restore server data or create an image. For details, see :ref:`Restoring from a Cloud Server Backup <cbr_03_0032>` and :ref:`Using a Backup to Create an Image <cbr_03_0016>`.

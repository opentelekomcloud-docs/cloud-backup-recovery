Sharing a Backup
================

Scenarios
---------

You can share server or disk backups with domains. Shared backups can be used to create servers or disks.

Context
-------

**Sharer**

-  Backups can only be shared among domains in the same region. They cannot be shared across regions.
-  Encrypted backups cannot be shared. Backups cannot be shared across regions. Account to which a backup is shared must be in the same region as the backup.
-  When a sharer deletes a shared backup, the backup will also be deleted from the recipient's account, but the disks or servers previously created using the backup will be retained.

**Recipient**

-  A recipient must have at least one backup vault to store the accepted shared backup, and the vault's remaining space must be greater than the size of the backup to be accepted.
-  A recipient can choose to accept or reject a backup. After accepting a backup, the recipient can use the backup to create new servers or disks.
-  When a sharer deletes a shared backup, the backup will also be deleted from the recipient's account, but the disks or servers previously created using the backup will be retained.

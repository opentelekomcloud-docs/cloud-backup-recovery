Sharing a Backup
================

You can share a server or disk backup with other domains. Shared backups can be used to create servers or disks.

Context
-------

**Sharer**

-  Backups can only be shared among domains in the same region.
-  Encrypted backups cannot be shared. Backups cannot be shared across regions. Account to which a backup is shared must be in the same region as the backup.
-  Accepted shared backups will be deleted once the sharer deletes the original backup. If a shared backup has been used to create new disks or servers, the created resources will not be deleted.

**Recipient**

-  A recipient must have at least one backup vault to store the accepted shared backup, and the vault remaining space must be greater than the size of the backup to be accepted.
-  A recipient can choose whether to accept a backup. After accepting a backup, the recipient can use the backup to create new servers or disks.
-  Accepted shared backups will be deleted once the sharer deletes the original backup. If a shared backup has been used to create new disks or servers, the created resources will not be deleted.

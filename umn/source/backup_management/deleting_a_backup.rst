Deleting a Backup
=================

You can delete unwanted backups to reduce space usage and costs.

Context
-------

CBR supports manual deletion of backups and automatic deletion of expired backups. The latter is implemented based on the backup retention rule in the backup policy. For details, see :ref:`Creating a Backup Policy <cbr_03_0025>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  At least one backup exists.
-  The backup to be deleted is in the **Available** or **Error** state.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to CBR Console.

   a. Log in to the management console.
   b. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select your region and project.
   c. Choose **Storage** > **Cloud Backup and Recovery**. Select a backup tab from the left navigation pane.

#. On any backup page, click the **Backups** tab and locate the desired backup. For details, see :ref:`Querying a Backup <cbr_03_0013>`.

#. In the row of the backup, choose **More** > **Delete**. See :ref:`Figure 1 <cbr_03_0015__fig1233612574363>`. Alternatively, select the backups you want to delete and click **Delete** in the upper left corner to delete them in a batch.

Does CBR Support Cross-Region Backup?
=====================================

No. CBR supports only backup and restoration within a region but not across regions.

You can replicate backups in either of the following methods on the CBR console:

-  Select a backup from the backup list and manually perform a replication.
-  Select a backup vault and manually replicate it. Alternatively, you can configure a replication policy to periodically replicate backups that have not been replicated or failed to be replicated to the destination region.

Does CBR Support Cross-Region Backup?
=====================================

You can replicate backups to a destination region and create images in the destination region using the generated replicas.

You can replicate backups in either of the following methods on the CBR console:

-  Select a backup from the backup list and manually perform a replication.
-  Select a backup vault and manually replicate it. Alternatively, you can configure a replication policy to periodically replicate backups that have not been replicated or failed to be replicated to the destination region.

For details, see :ref:`Replicating a Backup Across Regions <cbr_03_0018>`.

Can a Server Be Restored Using Its Backups After It Is Changed?
===============================================================

Yes. If a server has been backed up and changed such as adding, deleting, or expanding disks, its backups can still be used to restore data. You are advised to back up data again after the change.

If you have added a disk after backup, using the backup to restore data will not change the data on the newly added disk.

If you have deleted a disk after backup, data restoration using the backup will not include the deleted disk.

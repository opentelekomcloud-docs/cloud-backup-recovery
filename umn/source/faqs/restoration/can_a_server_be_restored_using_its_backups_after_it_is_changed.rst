Can a Server Be Restored Using Its Backups After It Is Changed?
===============================================================

Yes. If a server has been backed up and then changed such as adding, deleting, or expanding disks, its backups can still be used to restore data. You are advised to back up data again after the change.

If you have added a disk after backup and then use backups to restore data, data on the newly added disk will not change.

If you have deleted a disk after backup and then use backups to restore data, data on the deleted disk will not be restored.

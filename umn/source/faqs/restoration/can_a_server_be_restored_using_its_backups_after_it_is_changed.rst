Can a Server Be Restored Using Its Backups After It Is Changed?
===============================================================

Yes. If a server has been backed up and then changed (adding, deleting, or expanding disks), its backups can still be used to restore data. You are advised to back up data again after the change.

If you have added a disk after a backup and then use the backup to restore data, data on the new disk will not change.

If you have deleted a disk after a backup and then use the backup to restore data, data on the deleted disk cannot be restored.

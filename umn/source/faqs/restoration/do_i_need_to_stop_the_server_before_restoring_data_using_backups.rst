Do I Need to Stop the Server Before Restoring Data Using Backups?
=================================================================

The system shuts down the server before restoring server data, and automatically starts up the server after the restoration is complete.

If you deselect **Start the server immediately after restoration**, you need to manually start the server after the restoration is complete.

Before restoring the disk data, stop the server to which the disk is attached and detach the disk from the server. After the disk data is restored, attach the disk to the server and start the server.

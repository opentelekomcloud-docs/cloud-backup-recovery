Can I Use a System Disk Backup to Recover an ECS?
=================================================

Yes. Before the recovery, you need to detach the system disk to be recovered from the ECS.

You can also use a system disk backup to create an EVS disk.

Disks created using system disk backups can only be used as data disks on servers. They cannot be used as system disks.

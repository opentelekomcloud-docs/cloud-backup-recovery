Do I Need to Stop the Server Before Restoring Data Using Disk Backups?
======================================================================

Yes. Before restoring the disk data using a disk backup, you must stop the server to which the disk is attached, and detach the disk from the server. After the disk data is restored, attach the disk to the server and start the server.

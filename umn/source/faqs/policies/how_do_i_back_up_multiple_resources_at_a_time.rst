How Do I Back Up Multiple Resources at a Time?
==============================================

#. Log in to CBR Console and click **Cloud Server Backups** or **Cloud Disk Backups** on the left navigation pane. On the displayed page, create a backup vault. It is recommended that the capacity of the vault be at least twice the total size of resources to be backed up.

#. Associate resources with the vault during or after the creation.

#. After the resources are associated, choose **More** > **Perform Backup** in the **Operation** column of the target vault. You can manually back up two or more resources at a time.

   Alternatively, you can set a backup policy for the vault. In this way, the system will automatically back up the associated resources at the scheduled time.

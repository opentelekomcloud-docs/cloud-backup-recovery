Dissociating Resources from a Vault
===================================

If you no longer need to back up an associated resource, dissociate it from your vault.

After a resource is dissociated, the vault's backup policy no longer applies to the resource. In addition, all manual and automatic backups of this resource will be deleted. Deleted backups cannot be used to restore data.

Dissociating a resource from a vault does not affect the performance of services on the resource.

Procedure

#. Enter the capacity to be added. The minimum value is **1** GB.

#. Click **Next**. Confirm the settings and click **Submit**.

#. Go back to the vault list. If the vault capacity in the Vault Capacity (GB) column is greater than the original capacity, the vault capacity has been expanded.

Auto Capacity Expansion
-----------------------

If you want a vault to be automatically expanded when its capacity is used up, enable auto capacity expansion.

If this function is enabled, the vault capacity will be automatically expanded to 1.25 times its current capacity when its capacity is used up.

Auto capacity expansion does not take effect if it is enabled after the vault is full.

#. Log in to the CBR console.

   a. In the upper left corner, click |image4| and select a region.
   b. Click |image5| and choose **Storage** > **Cloud Backup and Recovery**.

#. Locate the target vault and click its name.

#. On the vault details page, enable **Auto Capacity Expansion**. By default, this feature is disabled. It becomes unavailable when the vault's used capacity reaches or exceeds 100% of the total capacity.

   -  Enabled: When the vault's used capacity reaches or exceeds the limit, the vault automatically expands to 1.25 times its current capacity.
   -  Disabled: The vault does expand automatically.

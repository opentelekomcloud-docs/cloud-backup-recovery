What Is CBR?
============

Overview
--------

Cloud Backup and Recovery (CBR) enables you to easily back up Elastic Cloud Servers (ECSs), Elastic Volume Service (EVS) disks, and SFS Turbo file systems. In case of a virus attack, accidental deletion, or software or hardware fault, you can use the backup to restore data to any point when the data was backed up.

CBR protects your services by ensuring the security and consistency of your data.

CBR Architecture
----------------

CBR involves backups, vaults, and policies.

**Backup**

A backup is a copy of a particular chunk of data and is usually stored elsewhere so that it may be used to restore the original data in the event of data loss. There are the following types of backups:

-  Cloud disk backup: provides snapshot-based backups for EVS disks.
-  Cloud server backup: uses the consistency snapshot technology to protect data for ECSs.
-  SFS Turbo backup: backs up data of SFS Turbo file systems.

**Vault**

CBR stores backups in vaults. Before creating a backup, you need to create at least one vault and associate the resources you want to back up with the vaults. Then the resources can be backed up to the associated vaults.

Different types of resources must be backed up to different types of vaults. For example, cloud servers must be backed up to server backup vaults, not disk backup vaults or any other types of vaults.

**Policy**

-  A backup policy defines when you want to take a backup and for how long you would retain each backup.

   +=================+================================================+==============================================================================================+===================================================================================================================+
   | What to back up | All disks (system and data disks) on a server  | One or more specific disks (system or data disks)                                            | SFS Turbo file systems                                                                                            |
   +-----------------+------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | When to use     | You want to back up entire cloud servers.      | You want to back up only data disks.                                                         | You want to back up entire SFS Turbo file systems.                                                                |
   +-----------------+------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Advantages      | All disks on a server are backed up at a time. | Only data of specific disks is backed up, which costs less than backing up an entire server. | File system data and their backups are stored separately, and the backups can be used to create new file systems. |
   +-----------------+------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Backup Mechanism
----------------

CBR in-cloud backup offers block-level backup. The first backup is a full backup and backs up all used data blocks. For example, if a disk size is 100 GB and 40 GB has been used, only the 40 GB of data is backed up. An incremental backup backs up only the data changed since the last backup to save the storage space and backup time.

A backup will not be deleted if it is depended on by other backups, ensuring that other backups can still be used for restoration. Both a full backup and an incremental backup can be used to restore data to a given backup point in time.

When creating a backup of a disk, CBR also creates a snapshot for it. CBR keeps only the latest snapshot. Every time it creates a new snapshot during backup, it deletes the old snapshot.

CBR stores backups in OBS to ensure data security.

Backup Options
--------------

CBR supports one-off backup and periodic backup. A one-off backup is manually created and is executed only once. Periodic backup tasks are automatically executed based on a user-defined backup policy.

:ref:`Table 2 <cbr_01_0002__table31963779194543>` compares the two backup options.

   | Application scenario   | Executed before patching or upgrading the OS or upgrading an application. A one-off backup can be used for restoration if the patching or upgrading fails. | Executed for routine maintenance. The latest backup can be used for restoration if an unexpected failure or data loss occurs. |
   +------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

You can also use the two backup options together if needed. For example, you can associate resources with a vault and apply a backup policy to the vault to execute periodic backup for all the resources in the vault. Additionally, you can perform a one-off backup for the most important resources to enhance data security. :ref:`Figure 2 <cbr_01_0002__fig190314191275>` shows the use of the two backup options.

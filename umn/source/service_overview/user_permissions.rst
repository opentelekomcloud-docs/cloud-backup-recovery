User Permissions
================

If you need to assign different permissions to employees in your enterprise to access your CBR resources, IAM is a good choice for fine-grained permissions management. IAM provides identity authentication, permissions management, and access control, helping you secure access to your cloud resources.

The system provides two types of user permissions by default: user management and resource management.

-  User management refers to management of users, user groups, and user group permissions.
-  Resource management refers to control of operations on cloud service resources.
